## Overview

Redmine Canvas Gantt provides a fast, interactive Gantt chart for Redmine by rendering the timeline on HTML5 Canvas while keeping the left sidebar editable. It is intended for projects where the default Redmine Gantt becomes hard to read or slow to operate.

## Features

- High-performance timeline rendering with smooth scrolling and zooming
- Drag to move tasks, resize date ranges, and create dependencies from task endpoints
- Dependency management with create, update, and remove operations
- Inline quick edit for subject, assignee, status, progress, due date, and custom fields
- Drag and drop to change parent-child relationships in the sidebar
- Bulk subtask creation from multiple subject lines
- Baseline snapshots for visual comparison, with filtered-view or whole-project save scope
- Filters and grouping by project, assignee, status, version, and subject text
- Synchronization of display columns and sorting when selecting a saved query
- Visual indicators (blue badges) on the toolbar when a query or filter is active
- Version headers, progress line, row height presets, and persistent UI preferences

## Requirements

- Redmine 6.x
- Ruby 3.x
- Node.js 20+ for SPA build and frontend development
- REST API enabled in Redmine

### Security and impact

- Database migration: none
- Added permissions: `view_canvas_gantt`, `edit_canvas_gantt`
- Uninstall: remove the plugin directory and restart Redmine

## Installation

1. Clone the plugin into Redmine's `plugins/` directory.

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/redmine/plugins
   git clone https://github.com/tiohsa/redmine_canvas_gantt.git
   ```

2. Restart Redmine.

   Restart your application server after placing the plugin.

## Usage

1. Enable the REST API.
   Go to **Administration** -> **Settings** -> **API** and enable **Enable REST web service**.

2. Enable the project module.
   Open **Project** -> **Settings** -> **Modules** and enable **Canvas Gantt**.

3. Grant permissions.
   In **Administration** -> **Roles and permissions**, grant `view_canvas_gantt` and `edit_canvas_gantt` as needed.

4. Open the chart.
   Click **Canvas Gantt** from the project menu.

5. Interact with tasks.
   - Zoom with Ctrl/Cmd + mouse wheel or toolbar controls.
   - Drag tasks to move them on the timeline.
   - Drag task edges to resize date ranges.
   - Drag from endpoint dots to create dependencies.
   - Open dependency editing to adjust relation type or delay, or remove the relation.
   - Drag a sidebar row onto another task to make it a child issue.
   - Use bulk subtask creation to add multiple child issues at once.

### Baseline snapshots

- Baseline is a comparison-only feature. It is not used as input for scheduling or CPM calculations.
- Each project stores a single baseline snapshot, and saving a new one replaces the previous snapshot.
- The toolbar lets you save either the current filtered view or the whole project as the baseline scope.
- Baseline bars and diff popovers only render for tasks currently visible in the chart, even when the saved scope was the whole project.
- Viewing baseline comparison requires `view_canvas_gantt`. Saving a baseline requires `edit_canvas_gantt`.

## Shared Views and Query Parameters

Canvas Gantt separates shared business conditions from personal UI preferences.

- Shared business conditions are resolved from the URL and optional `query_id`
- Personal UI state such as zoom, viewport, and sidebar width stays in `localStorage`
- Display columns and sorting are treated as shared state that synchronizes with Redmine's standard queries
- Display settings can also be shared across projects from the display settings menu. Shared display features include zoom level, view mode, chart position, progress line, task titles, hierarchy lines, orphan-point display, version headers, baseline visibility, visible columns, column order, dependency-based organization, column widths, sidebar width, custom zoom scales, row height, and sidebar font size.
- Project-specific query and filter state such as `query_id`, project selection, status, assignee, version, or custom field conditions is not shared
- When the Canvas Gantt tab opens a bare `/canvas_gantt` URL, shared query conditions fall back to the last-used state stored in `localStorage` for that project
- When the same shared condition is provided by multiple sources, the precedence is:
  URL parameters -> saved query (`query_id`) -> project-scoped last-used shared state -> defaults

### Query editing flow

Canvas Gantt does not reimplement Redmine's query editor. Query creation, editing, and saving are done in the standard Redmine issue list, and Canvas Gantt consumes both saved queries and the supported subset of Redmine issue-list URL parameters.

- Use the **Saved Queries** menu in the Canvas Gantt toolbar to browse saved Redmine queries that are visible in the current project
- Select a saved query to apply its `query_id` and reload Canvas Gantt from Redmine's saved query definition
- Use **Clear saved query** to remove `query_id` while keeping the currently resolved shared filters in the URL
- Use **Save custom query** to open the standard Redmine issue list inside an iframe dialog and save the current filter set without leaving Canvas Gantt
- Use **Edit Query in Redmine** from the same menu to open the standard issue list in the current tab
- Adjust filters in the Redmine issue list and save the query with Redmine's built-in **Save** action
- Use **Open in Canvas Gantt** in the issue list to return to Canvas Gantt with the current issue-list URL state
- When the issue list is showing a saved query, the return link includes `query_id`
- When the issue list is showing an unsaved standard filter, the return link carries the supported Redmine-standard filter parameters directly

The saved-query editor dialog also exposes **Open in new tab** as a fallback when the embedded Redmine page is not convenient to use.

`query_id` alone is enough only when the current view exactly matches the saved query. Display columns and sorting are also restored based on the saved query definition. If Canvas Gantt adds extra shared filters, visible columns, or sorting on top of that saved query, the toolbar sends `query_id` plus standard Redmine parameters so the issue list can reproduce the same view as closely as possible.

When the project menu opens a bare `Canvas Gantt` URL with no shared query input, Canvas Gantt restores the last-used shared filter state for that project and rewrites the browser URL to the canonical shared query params.

### Supported Shared Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `query_id` | Use an existing Redmine saved issue query as the base condition |
| `status_ids[]` | Filter by issue status IDs |
| `assigned_to_ids[]` | Filter by assignee IDs. Use `none` for unassigned issues |
| `project_ids[]` | Narrow the visible projects inside the current project/subproject scope |
| `fixed_version_ids[]` | Filter by target version IDs. Use `none` for issues without a version |
| `group_by` | Grouping criteria. `project` or `assigned_to` |
| `sort` | Frontend sort key plus direction. e.g., `subject:asc`, `startDate:desc` |
| `c[]` | Specify visible columns (compatible with Redmine's `c[]`). e.g., `c[]=subject&c[]=status` |
| `show_subprojects` | Subproject visibility. `0` to hide, omit or `1` to include |

### Compatibility with Redmine Issue List

| Category | Supported Items |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Parameters** | `set_filter=1`, `f[]`, `op[field]`, `v[field][]`, `c[]`, `group_by`, `sort` |
| **Fields** | `status_id`, `assigned_to_id`, `project_id`, `fixed_version_id`, `subproject_id` |
| **Operators** | `=` (equal), `*` (all), `!*` (none), `o` (open), `c` (closed) |

Current compatibility limits:

- Unsupported Redmine fields or operators are ignored and shown as warnings
- `assigned_to_id` with both specific assignees and unassigned issues cannot be represented exactly when exporting back to the Redmine issue list, so the unassigned part is omitted with a warning
- Issues without a target version are supported in Canvas-specific URLs via `fixed_version_ids[]=none`, but that case is omitted when exporting a Redmine-standard issue-list URL
- Default sort (`startDate:asc`) may be omitted when exporting a Redmine issue-list URL

### Example URLs

Use a saved Redmine query as the base view:

```text
/projects/demo/canvas_gantt?query_id=12
```

Override a saved query with explicit status and assignee filters:

```text
/projects/demo/canvas_gantt?query_id=12&status_ids[]=1&status_ids[]=2&assigned_to_ids[]=5
```

Open Canvas Gantt directly from a supported Redmine-standard issue-list URL:

```text
/projects/demo/canvas_gantt?query_id=12&set_filter=1&f[]=status_id&op[status_id]==&v[status_id][]=1&group_by=assigned_to&sort=start_date:desc
```

Open a shared project/version view without relying on browser storage:

```text
/projects/demo/canvas_gantt?project_ids[]=3&fixed_version_ids[]=7&group_by=project&sort=startDate:asc
```

Hide subprojects and show only unassigned issues:

```text
/projects/demo/canvas_gantt?assigned_to_ids[]=none&show_subprojects=0
```

## Configuration

Configure the plugin from **Administration** -> **Plugins** -> **Canvas Gantt** -> **Configure**.

- **Inline edit toggles**: `subject`, `assigned_to`, `status`, `done_ratio`, `due_date`, `custom_fields`
- `row_height`: default row height
- `use_vite_dev_server`: load frontend assets from `http://localhost:5173` during development

### Compatibility note

If `redmica_ui_extension` applies Select2 behavior that interferes with Canvas Gantt controls, open **Administration** -> **Plugins** -> **Redmica UI Extension** -> **Configure** and disable searchable select boxes.

## Docker Quick Start

This repository includes `docker-compose.yml` for running a local Redmine 6.0 + MariaDB environment.

### Start the stack

```bash
docker compose up -d --wait
```

Open Redmine at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Load initial data

```bash
docker compose exec -T -e REDMINE_LANG=en redmine bundle exec rake redmine:load_default_data
docker compose exec -T redmine bundle exec rake db:fixtures:load
```

### Enable Canvas Gantt in a project

1. Open the target project.
2. Go to **Settings** -> **Modules**.
3. Enable **Canvas Gantt**.
4. Ensure the active role has `view_canvas_gantt` and `edit_canvas_gantt` if editing is required.

### Stop the stack

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Development

The SPA frontend lives in `spa/`.

```bash
cd spa
npm ci
npm run build
npm run lint
npm run test -- --run
```

For live frontend development:

```bash
cd spa
npm run dev
```

Then enable `use_vite_dev_server` in the plugin settings.

### Redmine integration tests

Run Redmine-backed Playwright tests from `spa/`:

```bash
npx playwright test -c playwright.redmine.config.ts
```

## Release

GitHub Releases are created automatically when a tag matching `v*` is pushed.

```bash
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

The release workflow only creates the GitHub Release with generated notes. It does not build the SPA or package extension artifacts.

## Build Output

- `npm run build` outputs the SPA to `assets/build/`
- On Redmine boot, the plugin links or copies those files into `public/plugin_assets/redmine_canvas_gantt/build`
- The fallback asset route is also available through `/plugin_assets/redmine_canvas_gantt/build/*`
